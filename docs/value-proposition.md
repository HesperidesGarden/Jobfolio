## Target Groups

**Job seekers**

JobFolio is the ultimate solution for career starters who want to make a strong impression in their job search. Our application offers a platform to create and manage a compelling portfolio, showcasing personal information, projects, and skills. With a focus on projects and individual capabilities, we cater to students and apprentices seeking opportunities in professions that don't require prior work experience. JobFolio revolutionizes the way career starters present themselves and connect with the right opportunities!

**Companies**

The platform benefits companies by allowing them to publish job offers and filter applicants based on their skills. This saves time in the recruiting process, as hiring managers can preview the job seekers projects and self evaluation before inviting them to a job interview. This ensures satisfactory results when hiring new candidates.

## Portfolio Creation

A well-crafted portfolio serves as a visual representation of one's skills, projects, and experiences, offering a comprehensive view of their capabilities. 

The creation of an appealing portfolio can be both time consuming and difficult to master. JobFolio aims to simplify this process to make sure that even those with limited technical expertise can effortlessly create an impressive portfolio by filling out simple forms. We include text fields for every skill and project for the user's self evaluation. This ensures that the employer has an exact image of the skill level and gives the portfolio owner the opportunity to list necessary details.

**Currently our website offers:**
* a short profile introduction
* projects overview and detailed view
* languages and skills


## Conclusion

  As students getting ready to dive into the job market soon, we noticed that building a great portfolio was pretty important. So, we thought, why not use our coding skills to make something we think is missing? We've been working hard to create a website that's practical and exciting â€“ the kind of stuff we would want to see out there. Our goal has been to understand what fellow job seekers like us need and then create a platform that can actually make a positive impact.
